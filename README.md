AI Assistant (LangChain + LangGraph)

This project is a command-line AI assistant built with Python, LangChain, and LangGraph.
It uses an agent powered by OpenAI’s chat models and supports tool calling, demonstrated with a custom calculator tool.

The assistant interacts with users in real time, understands natural language prompts, and dynamically decides when to invoke tools to solve tasks.
